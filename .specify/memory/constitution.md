# Orderly Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Extension-First Architecture
Every feature MUST be implemented as a Shopify checkout UI extension; Extensions MUST target appropriate extension points and support merchant configuration; Clear separation between UI components and business logic required; Extensions MUST be self-contained and independently deployable.

**Rationale**: Ensures proper Shopify ecosystem integration, merchant flexibility, and maintainable extension architecture.

### II. Shopify-Native UI Components
All UI MUST use Shopify's official UI Extensions React library; Components MUST follow Shopify's design system and accessibility guidelines; Custom styling MUST comply with Shopify's checkout branding constraints; MUST validate all component usage against Shopify's API specifications.

**Rationale**: Maintains consistency with Shopify's checkout experience, ensures accessibility compliance, and prevents breaking changes due to API incompatibilities.

### III. Extension Target Strategy
Extensions MUST use appropriate static or block targets based on functionality; Block targets for merchant-configurable placement, static targets for feature-specific positioning; MUST support multiple extension targets when functionality spans checkout phases; Extension configuration MUST specify clear target purposes and merchant benefits.

**Rationale**: Ensures extensions appear in contextually appropriate locations and provides merchants flexibility in checkout customization.

### IV. Network Security and Authentication
All external API calls MUST use session tokens for authentication; Network access MUST be explicitly declared in extension configuration; API endpoints MUST implement proper CORS and security headers; MUST handle authentication failures gracefully with user-friendly error messages.

**Rationale**: Maintains security standards for customer data and ensures compliance with Shopify's checkout security requirements.

### V. Progressive Enhancement and Error Handling
Extensions MUST degrade gracefully when capabilities are unavailable; MUST handle network failures, API errors, and permission denials; Loading states and error boundaries MUST be implemented for all async operations; Extensions MUST work regardless of checkout features enabled/disabled.

**Rationale**: Ensures reliable checkout experience across different merchant configurations and network conditions.

## Shopify Extension Development Standards

### Configuration Management
Extension TOML files MUST specify exact API versions and required capabilities; Settings MUST include validation rules and merchant-friendly descriptions; Localization files MUST be provided for all user-facing text; Metafield configurations MUST specify namespaces that won't conflict with other apps.

### Extension Lifecycle
Extensions MUST handle mount/unmount lifecycle events properly; State MUST be managed using React hooks and Shopify's extension APIs; MUST use Shopify's storage APIs for persistent data; Extensions MUST clean up resources and event listeners on unmount.

### Merchant Experience
Extensions MUST provide clear configuration options in the checkout editor; Settings MUST include helpful descriptions and validation feedback; Extensions MUST work across all supported Shopify checkout configurations; MUST provide merchant documentation for installation and configuration.

## Quality Gates

### Extension Validation
All Shopify UI components MUST be validated using Shopify's validation tools; Extension configurations MUST be tested across multiple checkout scenarios; MUST test with different merchant settings and checkout customizations; Extension targets MUST be verified for correct placement and behavior.

### Performance Standards
Extensions MUST load within 2 seconds on 3G networks; Bundle sizes MUST be optimized and unnecessary dependencies removed; MUST implement proper code splitting for large extensions; API calls MUST be debounced and cached appropriately.

### Accessibility Compliance
All UI components MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards; MUST provide proper ARIA labels and semantic markup; Keyboard navigation MUST work for all interactive elements; Screen reader compatibility MUST be tested and verified.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all development practices and decisions; All extension development MUST verify compliance with these principles; New features MUST justify complexity and demonstrate merchant value; Extensions MUST be reviewed for Shopify platform compliance before deployment.

**Amendment Process**: Requires documentation of changes, team approval, and migration plan for existing extensions.
